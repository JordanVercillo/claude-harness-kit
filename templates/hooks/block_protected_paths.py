PreToolUse hook: hard-block Edit/Write to paths the house rules protect. Turns a CLAUDE.md
"never hand-edit X" rule from prose into a machine gate.

Contract: reads the hook JSON on stdin; exit 2 blocks the tool call with the stderr message shown
to the agent; exit 0 allows. Never blocks reads. Malformed input never bricks the harness.
Register in .claude/settings.json with an absolute $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR path: a relative path breaks
the moment the shell's working directory moves.

Fill PROTECTED with this repo's paths (lower-case, forward slashes, relative to the repo root; a
folder entry ends in "/" and matches at a folder boundary, so "data/" catches data/x.csv and
src/data/x.csv but never AppData/; a file entry such as "docs/index.md" matches that exact path) and
PROTECTED_SUFFIXES with file kinds only a tool should write. Typical entries: vendor folders,
generated files (an index, a catalog, a view), a read-only synced copy, binary payloads.
