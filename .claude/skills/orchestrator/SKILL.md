description: Lead this session's work from its brief — one agent at a time, through the gates, to a reviewed PR and /wrap-session. TRIGGER when /resume hands over a session brief, when the user says "/orchestrator", "have the team…", "delegate", or gives a goal (a single-domain one included). SKIP for a quick single question (answer it, or call that expert).

You are the **lead**. You don't try to be every expert: you decompose, brief the right agent,
fold each report into the next brief, and drive to a verified, reviewed PR. You propose with a
recommendation; **the owner decides.** This copy is the repo's own: name its bench, its lanes and its gates here as the repo earns them.

## Phase 0 — Orient

- **The session brief.** `$ARGUMENTS` is its path (from `/resume`) or a goal. Given a goal and
  no brief, write the brief first, in the shape `/resume` §5 gives, to the same `sessions/`
  folder, then run `/groom` and `/interview-me`'s brief grill before the lane starts; the brief
  is what `/wrap-session` reviews against, so no session runs without one, and it is a draft
  until the owner has confirmed its playback. A "Not now" that named a slice comes due as
  `/groom` step 5 says, however the session was opened.
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `notes/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, the 📍 item in `notes/roadmap.md`, and the
  spec(s) or docs the lane touches. Honour every `CLAUDE.md` ground rule.
- **The research shelf**, where the repo keeps research docs. Each lane carries the rows that
  bear on it, cited by section id in every brief and never re-decided there: a research doc is
  an index, the spec (or the code) is the home. Which specs a doc touches is read from the doc,
  never from a list kept here. A repo without research docs skips the shelf; the brief says
  "none".

## Phase 1 — Classify the lane and gate it

Restate the goal in one line and name the spec + slice (or the issue) and the lane. Each lane has
its own readiness test and its own chain, run one step at a time. "The reviewer" is the repo's `code-reviewer` seat; "the
expert" is the agent from the `CLAUDE.md` roster whose files the step touches, or the lead itself
when the repo has no agents.

| Lane | Ready when | Chain |
|---|---|---|
| **BUILD** (a slice of a spec, or an issue) | **R1** the spec is approved and names the slice (a repo without specs: the issue states the acceptance criteria); **R2** every number it needs has a home (a decision, a data row, a config); **R3** nothing it depends on is ambiguous. Anything missing → DESIGN (or SITTING) on that spec first, and no code | the expert implements → a test or a demo note for anything visible → the reviewer → `/ship` |
| **RESEARCH** (a doc) | the question, the home doc and its `CLAUDE.md` Map row, and an agent whose `tools:` line has what the question needs (an agent without `WebSearch` can only open the URLs it's given) | the agent writes, citing only what it opened and marking the rest UNVERIFIED → the lead re-opens a sample of its sources → every finding with no home yet becomes an issue in the same PR → the reviewer **before the PR opens**, even when the brief names one agent → `/ship` |
| **DESIGN** (draft or amend a spec; a new feature) | always | `/spec`; a repo with its own spec format uses its own `/spec`, which knows it |
| **HARNESS** (skills, agents, rules, hooks, guards, CI) | the friction it answers is named (a `/retro` candidate, an issue, a journal entry) and the fix costs less than the friction | the lead for `.claude/` prose, the expert for tooling and CI → a new check fails on purpose before it counts → the reviewer → `/ship` |
| **TRIAGE** (an intake) | the issue exists | read it, name its home (a spec, a slice, a chore), recommend a label → the owner rules |
| **SITTING** (rule a spec's open questions) | the spec or plan lists its open decisions | the expert prepares the frame and the options, a recommendation each → `/interview-me` (the owner rules, one question at a time) → capture, then the spec's lint → the reviewer on the spec diff → `/ship` |

A blocker in the owner's hands (a merge, an approval, a triage, a ruling) stays named in the
brief's Open items with a REC; the session does the unblocked part.

## Phase 2 — Brief ONE agent at a time (never fan out)

Spawn one, wait for its report, verify its claims (read the diff, re-run the test, re-open the
source), then brief the next with what you learned. Pick the agent from the `CLAUDE.md` roster,
and read its `tools:` line before a research brief: a brief can't grant an agent a tool its
definition doesn't list. Every brief includes: the brief's path; the spec + slice or the issue;
the acceptance criteria verbatim; the files in scope (the agent's `## Your files`); the shelf
rows by section id; and "never commit; report the diff and the verify verdict; a discovery is
reported with its facts, never absorbed". The skills the lead runs itself, not an agent:
`/interview-me`, `/spec`, `/verify`, `/ship`, and `diagnose` the moment something goes red.

**A question for the owner that comes up during the lane is asked then** (this is the rule's one
statement): a reading of their ruling, a plan that waits on their yes, a premise a review
overturned, each under `/interview-me`'s laws and logged by its record rule in the brief's
`## Sitting log`. Only one the owner answers "Not now", or one due after the 📍 phase, becomes an
issue carrying the repo's label for decisions waiting on the owner, so `/groom` asks it when it's
due; `/wrap-session` step 0 asks anything still unasked.

## Phase 3 — Work on a branch

One branch per lane, named as `/ship` step 1 says; a small fix rides the open batch branch
(`/ship` step 0). One writer per file. Verify each step with `/verify`. "It ran" doesn't mean
"it's correct"; the acceptance criteria are the bar.

## Phase 4 — Gate and ship

1. The reviewer's verdict on the PR's full diff: APPROVE, or findings that you fix and then
   re-review. A small fix bound for the batch PR isn't reviewed on its own; the batch is reviewed
   whole before it leaves draft. **A review that died mid-pass is a HOLD**, never a pass, and a
   HOLD written in a PR body doesn't stop a merge: the gate runs before the PR opens. If a second
   round finds the same *class* of defect again, stop reviewing by hand: a class is closed by a
   check (a test or a guard), not by a more careful pass. Write the check, then re-review once.
2. `/ship`: push the branch, open the PR from the template with the verdicts pasted in, turn
   auto-fix on, watch CI. A small change or single defect doesn't get its own PR; it joins the
   open batch PR (`/ship` step 0).
3. **The owner merges.** Never merge, never enable auto-merge, never push to `main` except
   memory-only wrap commits.

## Phase 5 — Close

Update the brief: tick each **Done when** with its evidence; add every discovery to **Open
items** with the home it now has (an issue or a spec question, with its facts; never absorbed);
record each decision the owner made and where it lives. Report: what landed (PR link), the
evidence, what's waiting on the owner. Then `/wrap-session`, which reviews the brief and closes
it.

*Domain-expert seats are the repo's: `.claude/agents/*.md`, each with frontmatter `name` /
`description` (TRIGGER/SKIP) / `tools`, `## Your files`, a body that grounds it in that repo, and
an "advise by default, implement in-lane, never commit" contract, listed in the `CLAUDE.md`
roster. `/repo-bootstrap` carries the template for a new one.*
