description: Start a session warm — orient from the repo's living memory, check its health, write the session brief, hand it to /orchestrator. TRIGGER when the user types /resume, "pick up where we left off", "get me back up to speed", or starts a session cold. SKIP for a specific new task that states its own goal (/orchestrator writes the brief then).

Get oriented from the repo's own memory, prove the state, spec the session, then start it. Run
the steps in order, in one turn. The turn ends with `/orchestrator` running on a written brief,
never with a question the repo could have answered. This copy is the repo's own: name its instruments (its checks, its tracker) here as the repo earns them.

## 1 — Recall (read the memory; don't re-derive it)

- **Sync first.** `git fetch origin`. On `main`, `git pull --ff-only`; on another branch,
  `git fetch origin main:main`, and read the memory from `origin/main:notes/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
  when the branch's copy is older. Other sessions, cloud ones included, merge while this one is
  closed, and a stale memory file is wrong memory.
- Read `CLAUDE.md` (ground rules, routing, map), `notes/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` in full,
  `notes/roadmap.md` (find the 📍), and the last 2–3 entries of `notes/journal.md`.
- **Continuations outrank the ➡️ NEXT ACTION**, in this order. Two kinds live in this repo's
  Claude Code project data folder, `~/.claude/projects/<project-key>/`, where `<project-key>` is
  the repo's absolute path with every character that isn't a letter or a digit made `-`
  (`/handoff` §1 says the same, with the worktree case):
  - first, a `/handoff` document in `handoffs/` (the SessionStart hook names the newest): its
    **Next step** comes before everything else until that task is done or wrapped;
  - then an open **session brief** in `sessions/` (not under `closed/`): the session that wrote
    it never wrapped, so its unticked **Done when** items and open items are this session's
    first candidates.
- **Unmerged memory.** `git branch -r --no-merged origin/main`: a `wrap/*` or `claude/*` branch
  that touches `notes/` is a wrap another session couldn't land (a cloud session can't commit to
  `main`). Read its session-log line and journal entry now; `/wrap-session` folds them into the
  memory and deletes the branch once the fold is pushed. Memory counts only once it is on `main`
  or on a PR that will get there.

## 2 — Health check (fast, deterministic)

- **The repo's deterministic checks**, the fast ones: the harness guards where the repo has them
  (`uv run scripts/harness_guards.py`, or the equivalent its `CLAUDE.md` names) and whatever lint
  or audit `CLAUDE.md` names. Report only the result. Don't run the full test suite or a build
  just to orient; if the repo keeps a verify verdict file, read it and say how fresh it is.
- `git status -sb` + `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`: uncommitted work, unpushed commits,
  and stray files at the repo root (a guard's output, a screenshot): each is a tidy item for the
  wrap, named now.
- `gh pr list --state open` and `gh run list --limit 3`: open PRs and red CI.
- `gh pr list --state merged --limit 10`: what landed since the latest session-log line. The
  memory may not know it yet.
- **The open items, live from the issue tracker:** `gh issue list --state open`, filtered the way
  the repo labels its work (the 📍 phase's milestone; a label for decisions waiting on the owner;
  a label for untriaged intakes). **The open-items ledger is derived here, every session, from the
  tracker and the checks; it is never stored in a file** (one home per fact). Issues the owner has
  marked as their own lane (a `dnd` label or its equivalent) are listed as DND only: never offered
  as work, never triaged, never counted as decisions waiting.
- A repo without an issue tracker: the open items are the 📍 phase's unticked roadmap items, and
  the brief says so.

## 3 — Emit the RESUME BRIEF

```
=== RESUME BRIEF ===
Repo:     <one line: what this is>
Where:    <roadmap phase + 📍 item>
Health:   <each deterministic check and its result, or "n/a">
Flags:    <behind origin / uncommitted / unpushed / stray files / open PRs / red CI / unmerged wrap branch, or "none">
Landed:   <PRs merged since the last session-log line, or "nothing new">
Left off: <the latest dated session-log line>
➡️ NEXT:  <PROJECT_CONTEXT's ➡️ NEXT ACTION verbatim>
Open:     <open items as #n title, grouped: blocks the next lane / doesn't>
DND:      <the owner's own lanes (hands off), or "none">
Owner:    <decisions waiting on the owner: merges, approvals, triages, rulings>
```

**Never end the turn on the brief.** It's orientation, not a deliverable.

## 4 — Spec this session: write the session brief

Pick the lane: the continuation from step 1 if there is one; otherwise the first item of the
➡️ NEXT ACTION that nothing in the owner's hands blocks. When the first item is blocked (a merge,
an approval, a triage, a ruling), name the blocker and whose hand it's in, and take the next
unblocked item in the roadmap's order; a session never idles on the owner while the roadmap has
unblocked work. Ask only when two lanes are equally next and the roadmap doesn't order them.

Write the brief to `~/.claude/projects/<project-key>/sessions/<yyyy-mm-dd-HHmm>-<slug>.md`
(next to `handoffs/`: outside the repo, so it is never committed, and inside Claude Code's own
project data, so it survives the scratchpad; create the folder if it's missing). Continuing an
open brief: append to it instead of writing a new one; when the lane changes, move the old brief
to `closed/` with a one-line pointer to the new one, so only one brief is ever open. Its shape:

```
# Session brief — <yyyy-mm-dd> — <slug>
**Goal:** <one line> · **Lane:** BUILD <spec or issue, slice k> | RESEARCH | DESIGN | HARNESS | TRIAGE | SITTING <spec> · **Roadmap item:** <the tick it advances>

## Why now
<the 📍, and what this session unblocks>

## Scope
**In:** … · **Out:** … (named, so a discovery is slotted, not absorbed)

## Research to carry
<the repo's research docs that bear on this lane, cited by section id; "none" when the repo keeps none>

## Open items
| Item | Home (#issue / spec question / PR) | Blocks this session? | Whose hand |
|---|---|---|---|

## Plan
<the steps in order, one agent or skill per step: the expert agent from the CLAUDE.md roster when the repo has one, else the lead itself; the skill (/interview-me, /spec, /verify, /ship) per step>

## Done when
- [ ] <observable: a check's result, a PR state, a file, a verdict> — proof: <how /wrap-session checks it>

## Owner's decisions needed
- <decision> — REC: <recommendation and why>
```

Rules for the brief: every open item already has a home or gets one now (an issue, a spec
question, a PR). "Blocks" is yes only when a Done-when item can't be met without it. Each
Done-when line is something a cold reader can check. The plan names one agent per step, never
two at once.

## 5 — Kick off

In this same turn, hand the brief to `/orchestrator` with its path: `/orchestrator <brief path>`
.
Single-step work goes through it too (it reads the brief, runs the one step, and closes through
`/wrap-session`). The one exception is a session with nothing unblocked: report that with the
blockers and whose hands they're in, and stop. End every working session with `/wrap-session`.
