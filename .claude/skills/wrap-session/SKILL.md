Distil THIS conversation into the repo's memory: a map, not a transcript. `/resume` reads what
you write here, so write for a cold reader, and write the ➡️ NEXT ACTION as its instructions.
This copy is the repo's own: list what the repo regenerates before a commit here. The memory's shape and budgets are the repo's
(`CLAUDE.md`, the protocol paragraph in `notes/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`); read them before editing.

0. **Session review.** Read the session brief: the newest open file in
   `~/.claude/projects/<project-key>/sessions/` (`/resume` §1 derives the key). A session
   started without `/resume` has none: write its Goal and Done-when now from the conversation,
   so the review has something to check against. Then, for each **Done when** line: ✅ with its
   evidence (a PR number and state, a check's result, a commit hash, a verdict, a file) or ⬜
   with why. Every ⬜ is carried or slotted, never dropped: into the ➡️ NEXT ACTION when it's the
   next lane's first step, otherwise into an issue or a spec question with its facts. For each
   decision made: who made it and where it's recorded (a spec row, an issue comment, a PR); one
   recorded nowhere is recorded now or flagged. Decisions still waiting on the owner go to the
   RESUME block. Append the review to the brief as `## Review`.
1. **Re-read the conversation.** Identify decisions made (with who made them), work completed
   (with evidence: verify verdict, test counts, PR/commit hashes, CI run), surprises, and the
   agreed next step.
2. **`notes/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`:** rewrite **Status** and **➡️ NEXT ACTION** in place (the
   RESUME block stays short, ≤ 20 lines); add new key files/conventions; append one dated
   **Session log** line ending "**Left off:** …"; fix any fact this session proved stale.
   The ➡️ NEXT ACTION is `/resume`'s instruction: the next lane, what blocks it and whose hand
   that's in, and the first unblocked alternative. The open-items ledger itself lives in the
   issue tracker and the checks, derived at resume; don't copy it here. Stay inside the budgets
   the `memory_budget` guard enforces: the file ≤ 150 lines and the Session log ≤ 10 entries.
   Condense or drop the oldest entries to fit (a fact that lives nowhere else moves to the
   roadmap, the journal or an area README first); history lives in git.
3. **`notes/roadmap.md`:** tick what landed; move the **📍 we are here** marker if the position
   changed; keep "Immediate next step" identical to the ➡️ NEXT ACTION.
4. **`notes/journal.md`:** a genuine surprise gets a numbered entry (situation → **The
   realization:** → `>` takeaway). Routine progress doesn't. Number it against the journal on
   `origin/main`, not the branch's copy (two sessions numbering against their own branches both
   claim the same number), and land it in the same PR as anything that cites it.
5. **Retro, when the session fought the harness.** Run `/retro` (through the Skill tool) when any
   of these happened: a gate or check failed twice on the same class; an edit was reverted, or a
   commit carried a file nobody meant to stage; the owner answered a question the repo already
   knew; a tool call cost a round (a blocking call, a reload race, an output too big to read); a
   skill step was skipped or a rule misread; a session's memory had to be recovered from a
   branch or a transcript; an agent lacked a tool its brief assumed. When none did, the report
   says "no retro: no friction logged". Each candidate is slotted as `/retro` step 4 routes it.
   The wrap does three of those slots itself: a journal entry rides this wrap commit; an issue is
   filed per check or hook; a one-line prose fix the owner OKs in this session rides the open
   batch PR through `/ship` step 0 (where that tier is installed; otherwise a small PR of its
   own). Nothing else is applied inside the wrap: the loop closes when the next `/resume` lists
   the issue among the open items and the owner slots it.
6. **Regenerate anything generated** (an index, a catalog, a view, a dashboard) with the
   generator `CLAUDE.md` or `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` names, so the committed copy can't drift; never
   hand-edit it. A generated page that is published somewhere (an artifact, a site) is
   republished in place, and its URL stays in PROJECT_CONTEXT's Key files.
7. **Checks before commit:** the harness guards where the repo has them
   (`uv run scripts/harness_guards.py`, or the equivalent its `CLAUDE.md` names) must pass, plus
   any lint `CLAUDE.md` names. A wrap may commit straight to `main`, and the guards check exactly
   what it edits (`memory_budget`), so a red guard is fixed here, never pushed.
8. **Tidy**, inside named bounds. Outside them the default is report-only: an instruction to a
   future agent is an action, just a delayed one, so anything beyond these bounds is listed for
   the owner, never done. Everything done here is listed in the report:
   - **Inside the repo:** `git status --short` shows only the memory files you're about to
     commit. A file it lists that this session's own tools wrote (a guard's JSON output, a
     verdict file, a screenshot no doc references) is moved to the scratchpad; a file whose origin
     you don't know is listed for the owner and left alone. This session's unfinished work
     reaches a branch through `/ship`, never the wrap commit. `git stash list` is empty and
     `git worktree list` shows one worktree; anything else is reported.
   - **Branches:** a local or remote branch that `origin/main` already contains
     (`git log origin/main..<ref>` prints nothing) is deleted with `git push origin --delete`
     and `git branch -d`. That containment check is the authority: `-d` tests against the
     upstream, which the push just removed, so when it refuses a branch the check passed,
     `-D` is allowed in the same step, right after the empty `git log`. A branch with commits
     past `main` is listed with its PR, never deleted, whatever its PR's state says. A `wrap/*`
     branch another session left is deleted only after its memory is folded into a commit that
     is pushed.
   - **Session files:** the brief, with its `## Review`, moves to `sessions/closed/`; a handoff
     whose task this session finished moves to `handoffs/closed/`; the scratchpad is cleared (it
     sits outside every repo, and nothing in it is a source of truth).
   - **Any other repo this session touched:** the same checks, with its changes on a pushed
     branch. Report the result.
9. **Commit and push the memory.** On `main`, a memory-only commit goes straight in:
   `git add notes/ <regenerated files> && git commit -m "wrap-session: <one line>" && git push`.
   **A wrap off `main` rides a PR:** a session on another branch puts the wrap commit on its open
   PR; with none open, the commit rides the batch PR through `/ship` step 0, or a PR opened for
   it where that tier isn't installed. A wrap that lives only on an unmerged branch is memory
   nobody has: never leave a `wrap/*` branch without a PR.
10. **Reply with:** the session review (each Done-when with ✅/⬜ and its evidence), the
    session-log line, the ➡️ NEXT ACTION, any journal entry, the retro line (its candidates and
    their homes, or "no retro"), the tidy result, and the roadmap with the 📍 marker (phases as a
    compact list, ✅ done / 📍 here / ⬜ next). Then two short parts for the owner:
    - **What changed:** in the work's own terms (for harness work, in how-we-work terms), not
      file names.
    - **What you can try:** something concrete to open, run or look at right now, with the one
      command or click. If nothing is new to try, say so.
